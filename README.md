# Smooth Scrolling Refurbished

This mod changes the scrollbar in any screen that uses it to be *smooth*.

It is meant as a replacement for the fantastic [Smooth Scrolling Everywhere](https://github.com/shedaniel/SmoothScrollingEverywhere) mod as it is no longer maintained. My mod uses no code from the original project.

If there is a bug or an incompatibility with another mod please let me know on [github issues](https://github.com/JustAlittleWolf/SmoothScrollingRefurbished/issues).
